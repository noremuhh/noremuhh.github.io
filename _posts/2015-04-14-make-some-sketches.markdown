SPACED is a space travel company providing the  ultimate experience for outer space travel with feature destinations like the Moon, Mars, Earth, and Europa.

One of their top features is their cheeky customer service and speedâ€”they can get you anywhere safely in our universe within 1 day.

#### Research

I began researching many flight booking websites. I was trying to evaluate what worked and what didn't work in each website. I went through the process of trying to book a flight to capture the user experience one has when booking a flight.

#### Site Map

I created categories for users to try to identify what types of services would fall under each category. I sorted the cards out myself first in order to give me a visual to compare on what I see vs. what they see. This gave me an idea of what a user might look for on the screen when they are looking for something in particular on the website.

#### Usability Testing

After the prototype of the website was complete. I asked three people to test my website prototype. None of them knew before hand what SPACED was about. I created a script and just read along and screen recorded their responses to the tasks given to them.
