SPACED is a space travel company providing the  ultimate experience for outer space travel with feature destinations like the Moon, Mars, Earth, and Europa.

One of their top features is their cheeky customer service and speed—they can get you anywhere safely in our universe within 1 day.

#### Research

I began researching many flight booking websites. I was trying to evaluate what worked and what didn't work in each website. I went through the process of trying to book a flight to capture the user experience one has when booking a flight.

#### Site Map

I created categories for users to try to identify what types of services would fall under each category. I sorted the cards out myself first in order to give me a visual to compare on what I see vs. what they see. This gave me an idea of what a user might look for on the screen when they are looking for something in particular on the website.

#### Usability Testing

After the prototype of the website was complete. I asked people to test my website prototype. None of them knew before hand what SPACED was about. I created a script and just read along and screen recorded their responses to the tasks given to them.

##### Participant

Cris is a 22 year old photographer, who currently does concert photography. He’s taken pictures for G-Eazy, Logic, Waka Flocka, Marc E. Bassy, and much more. Check out his work on Instagram: @visualsubject  

##### Tasks

**Task 1: Book A Flight**
Scenario: “You’ve always wanted to travel to space, and now you can with SPACED. Go through this website as if you are purchasing a ticket until you can get to the confirmation page.”

**Task 2: Locate My Trips**
Scenario: “You have booked your flight, but want to check the status of your flight, locate where you might find this information.”

**Task 3: Find Age Restrictions**
Scenario: “You want to make sure there aren’t any age restrictions in order to go into space, locate where you might find if there are age restrictions if any.”

##### Results

The testing itself lasted probably around 5 minutes total, thats excluding me having to explain what was going to be done. I expected him to be able to complete each task with ease, I had previously explained that it wasn’t an actual website, but more that he could click on the hotspots that were on the page to navigate. I didn’t expect him to actually try to input information on the the page. Which I had already inputted and thats when I had to explain to him, that the text couldn’t be changed, it was more of you can click on things. Maybe I should have explained it again before he started using the site.
