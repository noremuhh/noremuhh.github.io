### CSS Animations

Created a Google Doodle using CSS only. Used the plug-in [animate.css](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/) by Jon Eden to create this magical unicorn Google Doodle.

### Research
I wanted to create a unicorn Google Doodle. I researched previous [Google Doodles](https://www.google.com/doodles) on the Google website to kind of get an idea of what I was going to create. I also researched anything that had to do with [unicorns](https://www.google.com/search?q=unicorns&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwipgNDqrJHfAhUEKH0KHbYWD4EQ_AUIDigB&biw=1020&bih=650).
