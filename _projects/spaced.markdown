### What is SPACED?
SPACED is a mock space travel company providing the  ultimate experience for outer space travel with feature destinations like the Moon, Mars, Earth, and Europa. One of their top features is their cheeky customer service and speed—they can get you anywhere safely in our universe within 1 day. Purpose? Design a website.


### Research
Began researching many flight booking websites. I was trying to evaluate what worked and what didn’t work in each  website. I went through the process of trying to book a flight to capture the user experience one has when booking a flight.


### Site Map
Created categories for users to try to identify what types 
of services would fall under each category. Sorted the cards out myself first to give me a visual to compare what I see vs. what they see.  This gave me an idea of what where a user might look on the screen when they are looking for something in particular on the website.

### Usability Testing
After prototype of the website was complete. I asked three people to test my website prototype. None of them knew before hand what SPACED was about. Created a script and just read along and screen recorded their responses to the tasks.
