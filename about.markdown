# Norma Camacho

I am a Senior at Eastern Washington University, graduating Winter Quarter 2019. I grew up in a small town. I was drawn into design by competing in a design competition that my advisor signed me up for when I was in a club. I had no idea what I was doing and created a design on Microsoft Word and actually placed at regionals. Which led me to compete at state level. So here I am now.
